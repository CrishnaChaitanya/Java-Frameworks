This is like the package.json file.

Maven uses a set of identifiers, also called coordinates, to uniquely identify a project and specify how the project artifact should be packaged: 
- groupId – a unique base name of the company or group that created the project.
- artifactId – a unique name of the project.

e.g : GropupID - com.google
      ArtifactID - demo
      Package : com.telusuko.demo.web

If we want to add a dependency; then we have to mention it in the pom.xml as
e.g: for spring MVC
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework/spring-webmvc -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-webmvc</artifactId>
    <version>5.3.21</version>
</dependency>

---------------------------

MAVEN HAS:
  1. REMOTE REPO
  2. LOCAL REPO

Whenever we ask for a dependency, It will first go to the Local repo and search there If its not available then it will go the Remote Repo.
